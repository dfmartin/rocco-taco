# Rocco Taco
This is a learning project.   It is intended to provide a project where multiple technologies can be employed without the need to come up with an idea for a project or the various features that it will support.

Ultimately, I hope to use this to expand my knowledge of various technologies.

## High Level Description
Rocco Taco is a taco resturant owned and operated by my dog Rocco.  It has a menu for the public to browse including descriptions, photos, and prices.  The public can place orders for pick up.  The application also has an admin mode where Roccoc can update the menu, and he can view orders and update them as ready for pickup.

## Technology Goals
Ideally this project would be able to run with little to no setup by the developer regardless of OS.  There may be versions that may require Windows when we look at .Net

### spefic technologies
In the beginning want to keep this simple and in my current skill set so it will be in React for the FE and express for the BE with simple persistence. (perhaps just memory with seeded data)

Eventually I plan to add variations at various places.  For instance, I may add backend database persistence.  Work with different React component libraries, CSS frameworks.  It will truly depend on where my interest take me.
